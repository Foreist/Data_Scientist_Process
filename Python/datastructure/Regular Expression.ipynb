      "Americans.\"\"\n",
      "Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it\n",
      "seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. \"\"I think it's because they have this\n",
      "narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,\"\" he said. \"\"They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist\n",

      "this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very\n",
      "convenient narrative.\"\"\n",
      "Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to\n",
      "\"\"the terrorist attack\"\" in Libya as laiaarre.\"\" And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and\n",
      "vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. \"\"I think they want to do their very best to\n",
      "keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect\n",

      "Added Ryan, \"\"Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are\n",
      "saying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not.\"\"\n",
      "In an apparently related development, a Politico article posted last night said Romney advisers were\n",
      "divided over how aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One\n",
      "unnamed Romney adviser described them as \"\"a huge gift\"\" to the campaign. \"\"Across the board ??domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues ??President Obama has been outmatched by events,\"\" he\n",
      "said. \"\"He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched.\"\"\n",
      "But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as\n",
      "the central issue. \"\"They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic\n",
      "prospects are not very good and all that,\"\" the aide told Politico. \"\"Well, ROITIlley'S been trying to do that\n",
      "now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April ??and he's failed. The president is better at\n",

      "The source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney camp\n",
      "that took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to\n",
      "their new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise.\n",

      "attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980. \"\"They are so excited about it,\"\" he said \"\"Over\n",

      "intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the\n",
      "operation.\n",
      "However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,\n",
      "September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obarna's reaction to what happened in Libya\n",
      "\"\"inexplicable\"\" and added that Obama is \"\"more intent on campaigning than meeting his\n",

      "Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who\n",
      "became known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. \"\"This\n",
